# Competitive-Programming

Hey there! This repository has all my solutions to competitive programming problems I've done in the past. 

Competitive programming has been a side hobby since grade 10. I only started uploading my solutions to Github in grade 12.
Most of my old solutions were done in Java. More recent ones are done in C++.
